🕵️‍♂️ Documented Operations on Kali LinuxBy Rashid Iqbal | AI Red Teamer 🛡️“I don’t want fame, I want mastery.” — This is my journey through the terminal.📅 Project Roadmap & Research PhasesPeriodResearch PhaseKey Outlines & Operations CoveredDec, 2025Part 1: The Foundation🏗️ Ethics in Pentesting, Skill Evaluation, Building an Isolated Lab (VirtualBox/Kali), Folder Discipline, and Recon Tools (Nmap, WHOIS, Dig, Shodan).Jan, 2026Part 2: Web App Ops🌐 Client-Server Architecture, HTTP Methods (GET/POST), OWASP Top 10 (SQLi, XSS, Command Injection), and Burp Suite Mastering.Feb, 2026Part 3: Advanced Tactics🚀 Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation Workflows, Post-Exploitation Basics, and Professional Technical Reporting.🎯 My MissionWelcome to my personal digital war room! 🏛️ This repository isn't just a collection of notes; it’s my documented research journal where I chronicle my operations within Kali Linux. From the quiet whispers of passive reconnaissance to the precision strikes of web application exploitation, I’ve mapped out my path to mastery in the red-teaming world.🛡️ My Code of Honor (Ethics)In this world, skill without ethics is just chaos. ⚖️ I live by a strict professional code:Trustworthiness: If I don’t have the "Green Light" (authorization), I don’t touch the target. Period. 🚦Integrity: I report the truth, even when it’s boring. No fake bugs, no exaggerated threats. 🤝Confidentiality: My clients' data is a sacred trust. It stays locked down and encrypted. 🔒💻 My Digital Utility BeltI’ve spent countless hours sharpening my blade across various tech stacks:The Foundation: Deep-rooted knowledge in CCNA Routing & Switching and CCTV Security—because you can’t secure the software if you don't understand the wires. 🌐The Arsenal: My daily drivers are Kali Linux, Burp Suite, Nmap, and Metasploit. 🛠️The Logic: I build my own tools and games using Python, C++, and Godot (I love turning security concepts into playable levels! 🎮).The Speed: I clock in at 80 WPM ⌨️. In the heat of an operation, my documentation moves as fast as my thoughts.🏗️ The Lab: My Sandbox of ChaosI never "test in production." I’ve built a fortress-style lab designed for maximum safety:The Walls: I run VirtualBox/VMware with isolated NAT networks to keep the "malware" in and the "real world" out. 🧱The Hunter: A perfectly tuned Kali Linux machine, verified and hardened. 🐉The Prey: A collection of vulnerable targets like Metasploitable, OWASP Juice Shop, and DVWA for target practice. 🎯The Safety Net: I take snapshots of everything. If I break it, I travel back in time and try again. ⏳🔍 My Methodology1. The Art of Reconnaissance 📡I start in the shadows.Passive (OSINT): I use WHOIS, Dig, and Shodan to learn about a target without ever knocking on their door.Active: When it’s time to get loud, I use Nmap for service fingerprinting and Wappalyzer to sniff out the tech stack.2. Web App Operations 🌐I dissect how websites talk. By intercepting the conversation between the client and server using Burp Suite, I hunt for:Injection Points: SQLi, XSS, and Command Injection. 💉Broken Logic: Authentication flaws and file upload vulnerabilities.3. The Documentation Habit 📝I am obsessed with organization. If it isn't logged, it didn't happen.I use a strict numbered folder system (01_Project-Info to 07_Templates).My activity_log.md is my best friend—every command, every timestamp, every result is captured for 100% reproducibility. 📑📊 The Final Deliverable (Reporting)The hack is for fun; the report is for the client. 📈 I turn complex technical jargon into a roadmap for security:Executive Summary: The "Big Picture" for the bosses. 👔Technical Deep-Dive: The "How-To" for the admins, complete with screenshots and PoCs. 🛠️Remediation: I don't just find the hole; I show you how to patch it. 🩹👨‍💻 AuthorName: Rashid IqbalGitHub: https://github.com/NoxVesper📧 Email: echoinject@gmail.com💬 Suggestions for improvements or bug reports are highly appreciated!⚠️ Disclaimer: Everything here is for educational and ethical purposes.
